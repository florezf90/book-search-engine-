<h1>üë©‚Äçüíª About </h1>
</div>

The current app has been created with the intention of  practicing graphql and apollo server implementation in conjuction with mongoDB, while still using the library of react, which was introduced recently. The objective was acomplished by refactoring the book search engine application provided by the bootcamp, turning it from a RESTful API into  GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

The application will allow the user important functionality as signup, login, search for a favorite book thanks to an extensive third party API data, save the book to a favorite section, and delete them based on the user criteria.

    NOTE: please be advised that my main job was to refactor the application to implement the new conceps taught in the bootcamp
